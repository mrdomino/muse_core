Muse Core
---------

This library is intended to provide secure, simple reference implementations of
core Muse client algorithms.

It is fairly low-level. It should know how to send and read responses to serial
commands, how to deserialize packets off the wire, and when to transition the
connection state machine. It does not implement Bluetooth communication or
client-facing packet data types. It doesn't know anything about event loops or
threads.

Everything is reentrant except where specified.

It is still very incomplete. The packet parser is the only thing that's even
close to done -- everything else is likely to either change or go away, and the
packet parser API may also change.
