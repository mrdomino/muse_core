Muse Core
---------

This library is intended to provide secure, simple reference implementations of
core Muse client algorithms. It can be linked against directly as part of a
client software package, or used to verify a custom implementation.

It is fairly low-level. It should know how to send and read responses to serial
commands, how to deserialize packets off the wire, and when to transition the
connection state machine. It does not implement Bluetooth communication or
client-facing packet data types. It doesn't know anything about event loops or
threads.

Everything is reentrant except where specified.
